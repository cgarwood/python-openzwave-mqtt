Python library for the OpenZWave MQTT implementation.

Consumes MQTT output from https://github.com/OpenZWave/qt-openzwave/blob/mqtt/docs/MQTT.md

## Structure

Each object maps to one or two parts in the topic. A topic can contain the following parts:

- `<Prefix>`: the prefix of each topic. This is ignored in the processing. Usually `openzwave/`.
- `<CollectionType>/<CollectionID>`: The collection type and the ID of the item in the collection. Example: `value/3`
- `<CollectionID>`: Some objects will have a direct collection that is not typed in the topic. Example is the OZW instance in `<Prefix>/1`
- `<ObjectType>`: If there is only a single instance of a type under a parent. For example `node/2/statistics`.

### Example

A message is sent to topic `openzwave/1/node/2/statistics`. This maps to:

| Type                | ID  |
| ------------------- | --- |
| Prefix              | -   |
| `OZWInstance`       | `1` |
| `OZWNode`           | `2` |
| `OZWNodeStatistics` | -   |

## Message ordering

We work with signals to signal listeners when things change. However, when we connect to MQTT we will receive a lot of retained messages at once. To prevent signals being sent out of order, we will hold all messages for children until the parent has received its information.

This has been disabled for `OZWManager` and `OZWInstance`.

If we receive messages on the following topics:

1. `openzwave/1/node/2/statistics`
2. `openzwave/1/node/2`

We will process the messages in the reverse order:

1. `openzwave/1/node/2`
2. `openzwave/1/node/2/statistics`
