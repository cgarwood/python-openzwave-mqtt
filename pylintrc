[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Reasons disabled:
# locally-disabled - it spams too much
# unused-argument - generic callbacks and setup methods create a lot of warnings
# too-many-* - are not enforced for the sake of readability
# too-few-* - same as too-many-*
# abstract-method - with intro of async there are always methods missing
# unnecessary-pass - readability for functions which only contain pass
# import-outside-toplevel - TODO
# too-many-ancestors - it's too strict.
